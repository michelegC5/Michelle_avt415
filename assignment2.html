  <H1>The Arch</H1>
   <p><a href=https:"//thearc.org">Arch</a> is the largest organization that advocates for individuals with disabilities.</p> 
<img src="imageforusability.jpg" alt="It's a screenshot of the website" width="475" height="300"/>
<H2>Accessibility Audit</H2>
<H3>Page Title</H3>
<p>The title is good as it describes itself as an arc. The whole purpose of the site is to promote and guarantee rights for people with this disability.</P>
<H3>Alt Text for Image</H3>
<p>All the images on the site provide “alt text”.</p>
<H3>Text</H3>
<p><b>Heading:<b> The text is consistent as all the headlines are H1.</p>
<p><b>Contrast Ratio ("color contrast"):</b> Checking the contrasts ratio showed that the site failed on their normal text and having the ratio be 3.51:1. Their large text was divided with it being WCAG AA Approved but WCAG AAA being a failure. Graphical objects and user interface passed.</p>
<p><b>Resize Text:</b> The text works well and when at 200% it’s easy to read. There’s no issue with the resize text.</p>
<br/>
<H3>Interaction</H3>
<p><b>Keyboard access and visual focus:</b> You can navigate using the tab to go forward and tab-shift to go backward. Also, the arrow keys work to move up and down the webpage.</P>
<p><b>Forms, labels, and errors:</b> There isn’t any visible major issue but there seems to be a missing label.</p>
<br/>
<H3>General</H3>
<p><b> Moving, Flashing, or Blinking:</b> There no movement, blinking, or flashing on the site.</p>
<p><b>Multimedia (video, audio) alternatives,:</b> The site doesn’t have any videos but it an immersive reading that also provides audio to read the page. Plus they have an option for languages from a total of nine.</p>
<p><b>Basic Structure Check:</b> The structure looks well and there isn’t an issue that I can see.</p>
<br/>
<H3>Issue Found</H3>
<ul>
<li>A lot of missing alternative text</li>
<li>Linked image missing alternative text</li>
<li>Broken Aria Reference</li>
<li>Contrast errors</li>
<li>Image without title</li> 
</ul>
</br>
<H3>Recommendations</H3>
<p>I believe changing the color of the font and background to make it WCAG Approved. The webpage's layout/design is simple and not over decorative. Just changing the font and fixing the errors will due.</p>
